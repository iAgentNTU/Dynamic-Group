#### What I've done last week
- read two papers about machine learning tool
	* [CSCW15] Flock: Hybrid Crowd-Machine Learning Classifiers [1]
	* [CHI08] Investigating Statistical Machine Learning as a Tool for Software Development [2]

- meeting w/ Jane about machine learning tool project (1/21)
- meeting w/ Haochuan about community-in-the-loop idea and cscw16 plan (1/22)
- several meeting w/ chifatty about r324 data and tool design (1/21, 1/22, 1/23)
- r324 data plan @ hackpad

#### What I plan to do this week
- run multi-class classification on r324 data
	* data: image sequences, calendar, button data, ground truth

- record any troubles of using maching learning tool (WEKA)
- community-in-the-loop project
	* design claims
	* observe target online community

- meeting w/ Haochuan (1/29)
